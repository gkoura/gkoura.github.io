					My name is Gregory and I am a Physicist and a Full-Stack Developer. I
					initially started coding as a hobby, but quickly realized that it was
					something I was truly passionate about and decided to pursue a career
					change. It was a big decision, but I am excited to be able to do what
					I love and help others in the process. Beyond my professional life,
					I've been a scout for years. Tennis is another love though I donâ€™t see
					myself going to Wimbledon anytime soon. I embrace challenges and I
					aspire to be a digital nomad someday.
